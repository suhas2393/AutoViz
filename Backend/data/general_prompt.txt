I am providing a dataset labeled as {data} which contains various network-related information.

1. Keys to Consider: Please focus only on the keys mentioned in {displayedColumns} for analysis. All other keys in the dataset can be ignored.
2. Use of {keywords}: The {keywords} will guide you on the type of analysis required for the keys in {displayedColumns}. Please ensure that you analyze the keys based on the guidance provided by these keywords.
3. Output Format: Your output should follow this structure:
    1. Highcharts Config: The first part of your response should contain the Highcharts configuration (highcharts_config) in JSON format. 
    Create different chart configurations based on different sets of keys. And keep only line, column, bar and pie types of chart.
    Ensure that you include at most 5 charts, each representing a different aspect of the data.If the dataset contains any time-related columns, include a time series graph in the result.
    2. Insights: After the chart configurations, provide 5 key insights under the insights key. 
    Each insight should be in the form of a key-value pair, where the key is a number (1-5) and the value is a short insight or observation based on your analysis.
4. Important Notes:
    1. Keep the response in the JSON format and always follow the same format.
    2. Only consider the keys listed in {displayedColumns} for analysis and chart generation.
    3. Make sure that the Highcharts configurations are appropriate for the given data and that each chart focuses on a different perspective of the data.
    4. If any column contains time-related data, ensure to generate a time series chart.

Please process the dataset as described above and return the response accordingly.
